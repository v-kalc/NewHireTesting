# Telemetry

New hire onboarding app logs telemetry to [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/). You can go to the Application Insights blade of the Azure App Service to view basic telemetry about your services, such as requests, failures, and dependency errors, custom events, traces.

App integrates with Application Insights to gather bot activity analytics, as described [here](https://blog.botframework.com/2019/03/21/bot-analytics-behind-the-scenes/).

App logs a few kinds of events:

Events` logs keeps the track of application events and also logs the user activities like:

- [To do]

  Exceptions` logs keeps the records of exceptions tracked in the application.
